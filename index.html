                Our project aims to develop a machine learning model to diagnose respiratory illnesses in dolphins, advancing animal conservation efforts. Existing models rely on data from voluntarily beached dolphins, which limits their applicability to a broader population and fails to diagnose specific diseases like pneumonia. To address these limitations, our model will analyze in-water measurements, enabling assessments of captive dolphins, involuntarily beached dolphins, and wild dolphins captured temporarily. Using Python and the Scikit-Learn library, we will implement incremental machine learning to create a transparent and efficient supervised classification model hosted on a Shiny app, offering real-time respiratory health evaluations within 2-3 seconds. The model will detect abnormalities, diagnose diseases, and identify illness stages, with a focus on generalizability and robustness. Guided by Dr. Andreas Fahlman and Professor DeRuiter, our team—leveraging expertise in machine learning, data analytics, and neural networks—will collaborate to deliver a solution that empowers veterinarians to promptly assess and treat dolphins in various environments.
